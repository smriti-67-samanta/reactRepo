Overview
This assignment focuses creating a full fledged map application in React also optimising the performance by implementing React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback hooks. By applying memoization techniques, you will prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and improve overall application performance.

Problem Statement
we are looking to develop a location tracking and searching application using Google's Maps API or any free Map api (explore little). The aim is to create a user-friendly platform for efficient tracking and searching of various locations. Key features include real-time location tracking, address search, route planning, and point of interest (POI) search. Users should input their current location and destination, with the application providing optimal routes considering traffic and other factors. Additionally, users should be able to search for specific addresses, landmarks, businesses, or POI categories, with results displayed on an interactive map interface. The application must prioritize performance to ensure a seamless user experience, particularly in areas with limited internet connectivity or high traffic. It should also minimize data usage and battery consumption for mobile devices.

Additional Features:
Geofencing Alerts: Implement geofencing to notify users upon entering or leaving specified geographical areas.
Integration with External APIs: Integrate with external APIs, such as weather or any public transportation data, for additional context.
Multi-screen Support: Ensure compatibility with different screen sizes.
